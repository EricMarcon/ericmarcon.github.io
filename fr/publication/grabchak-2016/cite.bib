 abstract = {Modern measures of diversity satisfy reasonable axioms, are parameterized to produce diversity profiles, can be expressed as an effective number of species to simplify their interpretation, and come with estimators that allow one to apply them to real-world data. We introduce the generalized Simpson's entropy as a measure of diversity and investigate its properties. We show that it has many useful features and can be used as a measure of biodiversity. Moreover, unlike most commonly used diversity indices, it has unbiased estimators, which allow for sound estimation of the diversity of poorly sampled, rich communities.},
