Nothing on this website requires you to identify yourself.

Google Analytics is used to analyze the traffic. It does collect some information about you. See the [Google Analytics privacy page](https://www.google.com/analytics/policies/).

For each visitor to reach the site, Google Analytics collects the following non-personally identifiable information, including but not limited to browser type, version and language, operating system, pages viewed while browsing the site, page access times and referring website address. This information is presented to me as aggregated reports for the purpose of gauging visitor traffic and trends.
