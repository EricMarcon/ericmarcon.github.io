This course is dedicated to the students of the joint Master's program [Global Forestry](https://globalforestry.eu/).
It is an introduction to the dynamics of tropical forests. The objectives are to:
- Be able to describe the state and dynamics of a forest.
- Understand the dynamics of succession and the role of disturbances.
- Understand some fundamental theories.
- Introduce anthropogenic disturbances before looking at forest management and harvesting.
