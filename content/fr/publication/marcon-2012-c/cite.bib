 abstract = {Over the last decade, distance-based methods have been introduced and then improved in the field of spatial economics to gauge the geographic concentration of activities. There is a growing literature on this theme including new tools, discussions on their specific properties and various applications. However, there is currently no typology of distance-based methods. This paper fills that gap. The proposed classification helps understand all the properties of distance-based methods and proves that they are variations on the same framework.},
