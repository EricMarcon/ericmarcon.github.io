abstract: "Lianas are important components of tropical forest diversity and dynamics, yet little is known about the drivers of their community structure and composition. Combining extensive field and LiDAR data, we investigated the influence of local topography, forest structure, and tree composition on liana community structure, and their floristic and functional composition, in a moist forest in northern Republic of Congo. We inventoried all lianas ≥ 1 cm in diameter in 144 20 × 20‐m quadrats located in four 9‐ha permanent plots, where trees and giant herbs were inventoried. We characterized the functional strategies of selected representatives of the main liana taxa using a set of resource‐use leaf and wood traits. Finally, we used complementary statistical analyses, including multivariate and randomization approaches, to test whether forest structure, topography, and tree composition influence the structure, floristic composition, and functional composition of liana communities. The structure of liana communities was strongly shaped by local forest structure, with higher abundances and total basal areas in relatively open‐canopy forests, where lianas competed with giant herbs. Liana floristic composition exhibited a weak spatial structure over the study site but was marginally influenced by the local forest structure and topography. Only forest structure had a weak but significant effect on liana functional composition, with more conservative strategies—higher stem tissue density and lower PO4 leaf concentration and SLA values—in tall and dense forests. Finally, we found evidence of host specificity with significant attraction/repulsion for 19% of the tested liana and tree species associations, suggesting that the unexplained floristic variation may be partly attributed to these host‐species‐specific associations, although the underlying mechanisms behind remain elusive. Overall, our findings demonstrate that liana communities' structure can be much better predicted than their composition, calling for a better understanding of the implications of the large functional diversity observed in liana communities."
