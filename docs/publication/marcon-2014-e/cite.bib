abstract = {Similarity-based diversity (Leinster and Cobbold 2012) encompasses classical measures of diversity, including the number of species, Shannon and Simpson diversity, and also phylogenetic and functional diversity. We derive two estimators to allow applying it to real, often under-sampled data, and its decomposition into alpha, beta and gamma diversity when an assemblage of communities is considered.},
