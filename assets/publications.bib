  abstract = {• The elucidation of relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem processes has been limited by the definition of metrics of biodiversity and their integration into experimental design. Functional trait screening can strengthen the performance of these designs. • We suggest the use of Rao's quadratic entropy to measure both functional diversity and phyloge- netic diversity of species mixtures proposed for an experimental design, and demonstrate how they can provide complementary information. • We also present an index assessing the statistical performance of these independent variables in different experimental designs. Measurement of independent variables as continuous vs. discrete variables reduces statistical performance, but improves the model by quantifying species differences masked by group assignments. • To illustrate these advances, we present an example from a tropical forest tree community in which we screened 38 species for nine functional traits. The proposed TropiDEP design is based on the relative orthogonality of two multivariate trait axes defined using principal component analysis. • We propose that independent variables describing functional diversitymight be grouped to calculate independent variables describing suites of different traits with potentially different effects on partic- ular ecosystem processes. In other systems these axes may differ from those reported here, yet the methods of analysis integrating functional and phylogenetic diversity into experimental design could be universal.}

  abstract = {The expansion of selective logging in tropical forests may be an important source of global carbon emissions. However, the effects of logging practices on the carbon cycle have never been quantified over long periods of time. We followed the fate of more than 60 000 tropical trees over 23 years to assess changes in aboveground carbon stocks in 48 1.56-ha plots in French Guiana that represent a gradient of timber harvest intensities, with and without intensive timber stand improvement (TSI) treatments to stimulate timber tree growth. Conventional selective logging led to emissions equivalent to more than a third of aboveground carbon stocks in plots without TSI (85 Mg C/ha), while plots with TSI lost more than one-half of aboveground carbon stocks (142 Mg C/ha). Within 20 years of logging, plots without TSI sequestered aboveground carbon equivalent to more than 80\% of aboveground carbon lost to logging (-70.7 Mg C/ha), and our simulations predicted an equilibrium aboveground carbon balance within 45 years of logging. In contrast, plots with intensive TSI are predicted to require more than 100 years to sequester aboveground carbon lost to emissions. These results indicate that in some tropical forests aboveground carbon storage can be recovered within half a century after conventional logging at moderate harvest intensities.}

  abstract = {We characterised the among species variability in leaf gas exchange and morphological traits under controlled conditions of seedlings of 22 tropical rainforest canopy species to understand the origin of the variability in leaf carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) among species with different growth and dynamic characteristics (successional gradient). Our results first suggest that these species pursue a consistent strategy in terms of Δ throughout their ontogeny (juveniles grown here versus canopy adult trees from the natural forest). Second, leaf Δ was negatively correlated with WUE and N, and positively correlated with gₛ, but among species differences in Δ were mainly explained by differences in WUE. Finally, species belonging to different successional groups display distinct leaf functional and morphological traits. We confirmed that fast growing early successional species maximise carbon assimilation with high stomatal conductance. In contrast, fast and slow growing late successional species are both characterised by low carbon assimilation values, but by distinct stomatal conductance and leaf morphological features. Along the successional gradient, these differences result in much lower Δ for the intermediate species (i.e. fast growing late successional) as compared to the two other groups.}

  abstract = {In 2002, nearly 200 nations signed up to the 2010 target of the Convention for Biological Diversity, ‘to significantly reduce the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010'. To assess whether the target was met, it became necessary to quantify temporal trends in measures of diversity. This resulted in a marked shift in focus for biodiversity measurement. We explore the developments in measuring biodiversity that was prompted by the 2010 target. We consider measures based on species proportions, and also explain why a geometric mean of relative abundance estimates was preferred to such measures for assessing progress towards the target. We look at the use of diversity profiles, and consider how species similarity can be incorporated into diversity measures. We also discuss measures of turnover that can be used to quantify shifts in community composition arising, for example, from climate change.}

However, values provided by SPAD-502 are unitless and require empirical calibrations between SPAD units and extracted chlorophyll values. Leaves of 13 tree species from the tropical rain forest in French Guiana were sampled to select the most appropriate calibration model among the often-used linear, polynomial and exponential models, in addition to a novel homographic model that has a natural asymptote. The homographic model best accurately predicted total chlorophyll content (mu g cm(-2)) from SPAD units (R-2 = 0.89). Interspecific differences in the homographic model parameters explain less than 7\% of the variation in chlorophyll content in our data set. The utility of the general homographic model for a variety of research and management applications clearly outweighs the slight loss of model accuracy due to the abandon of the species' effect.}

Toutefois, il est tentant de vouloir préserver la richesse des données individuelles et travailler en conservant la position exacte des entités étudiées. Si tel est le cas, cela revient pour un statisticien à élaborer des analyses à partir de données géolocalisées sans procéder à une quelconque agrégation géographique. Les observations sont appréhendées comme des points dans l'espace et l'objectif est de caractériser ces distributions de points. Comprendre et maîtriser des méthodes statistiques qui traitent ces informations individuelles et spatialisées permet de travailler sur des données qui sont aujourd'hui de plus en plus accessibles et recherchées car elles fournissent des analyses très précises sur les comportements des acteurs économiques (ELLISON et al. 2010 ; BARLET et al. 2013). Dans ce cadre d'analyse, plusieurs questions méthodologiques importantes se posent alors au statisticien qui dispose de jeux de points à analyser : comment représenter et caractériser spatialement de telles données en utilisant des milliers voire des millions d'observations ? Quels outils statistiques existent et peuvent être mobilisés pour étudier ces observations relatives aux ménages, salariés, firmes, magasins, équipements ou déplacements par exemple? Comment prendre en compte les caractéristiques qualitatives ou quantitatives des observations étudiées? Comment mettre en évidence des éventuelles attractions ou répulsions entre les points ou entre différents types de points? Comment peut-on évaluer la significativité des résultats obtenus? etc. Ce chapitre a pour but d'aider le statisticien à apporter des résultats statistiquement robustes à partir de l'étude de données spatialisées qui ne reposent pas sur un zonage prédéfini. Pour ce faire, nous nous appuierons sur une revue de la littérature des méthodes statistiques qui permettent de caractériser des distributions de points et nous expliciterons les enjeux associés. Nous expliquerons à partir d'exemples simples les avantages et les inconvénients des approches les plus souvent retenues. Le code sous R fourni permettra de reproduire les exemples traités.}

  abstract = {Statisticians carry out close examination of spatialized data, such as the distribution of household income, the location of industrial or commercial establishments, the distribution of schools in cities, etc. Answers can be found through analyses of one or more predefined geographical scales such as neighbourhoods, districts or statistical blocks. However, it is tempting to preserve the individual data and to work with the exact position of the entities that are being studied. If that is the case, statisticians have to conduct analyses based on geolocation data without carrying out any geographical aggregation. Observations are taken as points in space and the objective is to characterise these point distributions. Understanding and mastering statistical methods that process this individual and spatialized information enables us to work on data that are now increasingly accessible and sought after because they provide very precise analyses of distributions studied (Ellison et al. 2010; Barlet et al. 2013). In this framework of analysis, statisticians who have sets of points to analyse are faced with several important methodological questions: how can such data with thousands or even millions of observations be represented and characterised spatially? What statistical tools exist that can be used to study these observations relating to households, employees, firms, stores, equipment or travel, for example? How can the qualitative or quantitative characteristics of the observations being studied be taken into account? How can any attractions or repulsions between points or between different types of points be highlighted? How can we assess the significance of the results obtained, etc? The purpose of this chapter is to help statisticians to provide statistically robust results from the study of spatialized data that is not based on predefined zoning. To do this, we will review the literature on the subject of statistical methods used to characterise point distributions and we will explain the associated issues. We will use simple examples to explain the advantages and disadvantages of the most frequently adopted approaches. The code provided in R will be used to reproduce the examples covered.}

We introduce the generalized Simpson's entropy as a measure of diversity and investigate its properties. We show that it has many useful features and can be used as a measure of biodiversity. Moreover, unlike most commonly used diversity indices, it has unbiased estimators, which allow for sound estimation of the diversity of poorly sampled, rich communities.}

  abstract = {Plant traits—the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants—determine how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, and influence ecosystem properties and their benefits and detriments to people. Plant trait data thus represent the basis for a vast area of research spanning from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology, to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem and landscape management, restoration, biogeography and earth system modelling. Since its foundation in 2007, the TRY database of plant traits has grown continuously. It now provides unprecedented data coverage under an open access data policy and is the main plant trait database used by the research community worldwide. Increasingly, the TRY database also supports new frontiers of trait-based plant research, including the identification of data gaps and the subsequent mobilization or measurement of new data. To support this development, in this article we evaluate the extent of the trait data compiled in TRY and analyse emerging patterns of data coverage and representativeness. Best species coverage is achieved for categorical traits—almost complete coverage for ‘plant growth form'. However, most traits relevant for ecology and vegetation modelling are characterized by continuous intraspecific variation and trait–environmental relationships. These traits have to be measured on individual plants in their respective environment. Despite unprecedented data coverage, we observe a humbling lack of completeness and representativeness of these continuous traits in many aspects. We, therefore, conclude that reducing data gaps and biases in the TRY database remains a key challenge and requires a coordinated approach to data mobilization and trait measurements. This can only be achieved in collaboration with other initiatives.}

We build an asymptotically Gaussian test for the hypothesis of randomness corresponding to a Poisson point process. We first compute the exact first and second moment of the Ripley K-statistic under the homogeneous Poisson point process model. Then we prove the asymptotic normality of a vector of such statistics for different scales and compute its covariance matrix. From these results, we derive a test statistic that is chi-square distributed. By a Monte-Carlo study, we check that the test is numerically tractable even for large data sets and also correct when only a hundred of points are observed.},

  abstract = {The analysis of benthic assemblages is a valuable tool to describe the ecological status of transitional water ecosystems, but species are extremely sensitive and respond to both microhabitat and seasonal differences. The identification of changes in the composition of the macrobenthic community in specific microhabitats can then be used as an “early warning” for environmental changes which may affect the economic and ecological importance of lagoons, through their provision of Ecosystem Services. From a conservational point of view, the appropriate definition of the spatial aggregation level of microhabitats or local communities is of crucial importance. The main objective of this work is to assess the role of the spatial scale in the analysis of lagoon biodiversity. First, we analyze the variation in the sample coverage for alternative aggregations of the monitoring stations in three lagoons of the Po River Delta. Then, we analyze the variation of a class of entropy indices by mixed effects models, properly accounting for the fixed effects of biotic and abiotic factors and random effects ruled by nested sources of variability corresponding to alternative definitions of local communities. Finally, we address biodiversity partitioning by a generalized diversity measure, namely the Tsallis entropy, and for alternative definitions of the local communities. The main results obtained by the proposed statistical protocol are presented, discussed and framed in the ecological context.}

  abstract = {The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) is one of the most recognized global patterns of species richness exhibited across a wide range of taxa. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed in the past two centuries to explain LDG, but rigorous tests of the drivers of LDGs have been limited by a lack of high-quality global species richness data. Here we produce a high-resolution (0.025°\,×\,0.025°) map of local tree species richness using a global forest inventory database with individual tree information and local biophysical characteristics from \textasciitilde 1.3 million sample plots. We then quantify drivers of local tree species richness patterns across latitudes. Generally, annual mean temperature was a dominant predictor of tree species richness, which is most consistent with the metabolic theory of biodiversity (MTB). However, MTB underestimated LDG in the tropics, where high species richness was also moderated by topographic, soil and anthropogenic factors operating at local scales. Given that local landscape variables operate synergistically with bioclimatic factors in shaping the global LDG pattern, we suggest that MTB be extended to account for co-limitation by subordinate drivers.},

Our empirical applications consider the distribution of French manufacturing firms in the Paris area and in France generally. For some geographic levels, results show significant concentration or dispersion of firms according to their sector of activity.}

Trois champs d'analyse seront successivement explorés. En premier lieu, nous cherchons ici à identifier les regroupements d'activités à différentes échelles géographiques. En effet, si certaines zones françaises comme la région Ile-de-France localisent une part importante de l'activité industrielle française et donc présentent une densité industrielle particulièrement élevée, à des niveaux géographiques plus fins, il existe également des regroupements d'activités non négligeables. Les systèmes productifs locaux notamment sont présents un peu partout en France et soulignent l'existence de pôles d'activités spécialisées à une échelle géographique très désagrégée (DATAR, 2002). Ainsi, en allusion à la célèbre Silicon Valley aux Etats-Unis, on distingue par exemple aujourd'hui la « Cosmetic Valley » près de Chartres (Centre) ou la « Plastic Valley » près d'Oyonnax (Rhône-Alpes). En second lieu, la quantification des niveaux de concentration spatiale par secteur d'activité à différentes dates sur la période 1993-2001 nous permettra de caractériser l'évolution récente de la concentration spatiale des activités industrielles en France. Cette seconde étape apparaît alors décisive pour identifier les différentes dynamiques intra- industrielles de concentration spatiale (ou de dispersion). Cette démarche nous permettra dans une dernière étape de mettre en évidence les territoires français en expansion ou en déclin par secteur d'activité.}

  abstract = {La biodiversité peut être mesurée de nombreuses façons. La dualité entropie-diversité fournit un cadre clair et rigoureux pour le faire. L'entropie est la surprise moyenne fournie par les individus d'une communauté. Le choix de la fonction d'information qui mesure cette surprise à partir des probabilités d'occurence des espèces (ou d'autres catégories) permet de définir les mesures de diversités neutres, fonctionnelles ou phylogénétique présentées ici. L'entropie est transformée en diversité au sens strict par une fonction croissante (l'exponentielle déformée), ce qui simplifie son interprétation en tant que nombre équivalent d'espèces. L'entropie phylogénétique généralise les indices de diversité classique, intègre si nécessaire la distance entre espèces, peut être écomposée et corrigée des biais d'estimation. Sa transformation en diversité au sens strict permet d'interpréter les valeurs sous une forme unique : un nombre équivalent d'espèces et un nombre équivalent de communautés. La diversité de Leinster et Cobbold généralise à son tour la diversité phylogénétique et permet d'autres définitions de la distance entre espèces. Le paramétrage des mesures (l'ordre de la diversité) permet de donner plus ou moins d'importance aux espèces rares et de tracer des profils de diversité. La construction de ce cadre méthodologique est présentée en détail ainsi que plusieurs approches différentes, qui constituent l'état de l'art de la mesure de la biodiversité.}

L'explication des phénomènes d'agglomération semble être à présent bien appréhendée théoriquement (Fujita et al., 1999 ; Fujita et Thisse, 2002) mais les recherches empiriques ne semblent pas avoir atteint un tel stade de maturité (Rosenthal et Strange, 2004, Ellison et al., 2010 ; Gibbons et al., 2014). Durant la dernière décennie, de nombreuses recherches en économie spatiale ont porté sur les mesures de concentration géographique. Les économistes retenaient traditionnellement des mesures reposant sur un zonage du territoire (comme l'indice de Gini) mais des travaux récents ont montré que discrétiser l'espace pouvait engendrer des biais (Briant et al., 2010). L'utilisation de mesures fondées sur les distances (séparant les entités analysées) et non sur un zonage est aujourd'hui recommandée (Combes et al., 2006). Notre contribution méthodologique montre qu'une attention particulière doit encore être portée à la définition de la concentration spatiale pour évaluer l'agglomération des activités économiques. À partir de la localisation des commerces de détail sur l'aire urbaine de Lyon notamment, nous montrons, en utilisant trois mesures de concentration récemment introduites en économie spatiale (Kd, D et M), que les résultats obtenus ne convergent pas systématiquement. Cette différence dans les estimations provient de la définition de la concentration spatiale retenue qui peut être absolue (présence importante d'activités), topographique (densité élevée d'activités) ou relative (surreprésentation de certaines activités). Nous recommandons alors que le choix de la mesure de concentration soit suffisamment motivé d'un point de vue théorique pour apprécier correctement le phénomène analysé et ainsi apporter une évaluation satisfaisante de la distribution étudiée.}

This means understanding tree community response to disturbance and the underlying processes. In that respect, we aim here to clarify taxonomic and functional post-disturbance trajectories, and determine the scope of the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH) that remains debated in tropical forests. We analyzed community trajectories following a disturbance gradient from 10 to 60\% of above-ground biomass loss in a Neotropical forest over 30 years. We considered trajectories along time of community taxonomic and functional trajectories in terms of richness, evenness, composition, and redundancy. We based on the annual botanical inventories of 75 ha of a Neotropical forest and on large trait datasets comprising seven leaf, stem, and life-history traits. We identified a decoupling between taxonomic composition, differing among communities, and functional composition, similar among communities and convergent in the functional space. The taxonomic diversity followed humped-shaped trajectories along time after disturbance depending on the initial disturbance intensity, which validated the IDH (Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis). The functional diversity trajectories, however, were homogeneous among plots and dismissed the IDH. We explained this decoupling by the variations in community functional redundancy that mitigated the functional impact of disturbance. Although consistent, the recovery of community composition, diversity, and redundancy remained divergent from the initial state after 30 years. These results acknowledged the need of decades-long cycles without disturbance to ensure community complete recovery.}

Location Amazonian rainforest, Paracou station, French Guiana. Methods We analyzed trajectories of recruited tree communities, from twelve forest plots of 6.25 ha each, during 30 years following a disturbance gradient that ranged from 10\% to 60\% of aboveground biomass removed. We measured recruited community taxonomic composition turnover, compared to whole predisturbance community, and assessed their functional composition by measuring the community weighted means for seven leaf, stem, and life-history functional traits. We also measured recruited community taxonomic richness, taxonomic evenness, and functional diversity and compared them to the diversity values from a random recruitment process. Results While control plots trajectories resembled random recruitment trajectories, postdisturbance trajectories diverged significantly. This divergence corresponded to an enhanced recruitment of light-demanding species that became dominant above a disturbance intensity threshold. After breakpoints in time, though, recruitment trajectories returned to diversity values and composition similar to those of predisturbance and control plots community. Conclusions Following disturbance, recruitment processes specific to undisturbed community were first replaced by the emergence of more restricted, deterministic recruitment processes favoring species with efficient light use and acquisition. Then, a second phase corresponded to a decades-long recovery of recruits predisturbance taxonomic and functional diversity and composition that remained unachieved after 30 years.},

  abstract = {Many recent studies have searched to integrate species' functions and phylogenies in the measurement of biodiversity. To obtain easily interpretable measures, some researchers recommended diversity indices expressed in terms of equivalent numbers of species: the number of equally likely and maximally dissimilar species needed to produce the given value of diversity. Then, biodiversity is often calculated at three scales: within communities (α diversity), among communities (β diversity) and in a region (γ diversity). These three scales are, however, insufficient to tackle the organization of biodiversity in space because, for most organisms, there is a nested hierarchy of multiple scales characterized by different patterns and processes, from the small neighbourhood to the biosphere. We developed methodologies for analysing species, functional, taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity in a hierarchy of multiple scales using equivalent numbers of species. As an example, we analysed the taxonomic and functional diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblages in the Loire River, France, at four levels: within sites (α diversity), among sites within geological regions (β1 diversity), among geological regions (β2 diversity) and at the river scale (γ diversity). The new hierarchical approaches of biodiversity revealed very low differences among sites within regions and among regions in terms of taxonomy and functional traits (size and diet), despite moderate, significant species turnover among geological regions. We compare our framework with those other authors have developed. We argue that different definitions of α, β, γ diversities are used in the literature reflecting different points of view on biodiversity. We make recommendations on how to normalize functional (or phylogenetic) dissimilarities among species to render sites and regions comparable, and discuss the pros and cons of our approach. The hierarchical approaches of biodiversity in terms of ‘equivalent numbers' respond to current demands to obtain intuitive, easily interpretable components of biodiversity. The approaches we propose go beyond current developments by considering a hierarchy of spatial scales and unbalanced sampling design. They will provide powerful tools to detect the ecological and evolutionary processes that act differently at different scales.}

  abstract = {Termite mounds have been poorly studied in tropical rainforest in contrast to those of savannahs where they create fertility hotspots and influence the spatial pattern of vegetation. An inventory of termite mounds and of 15 tree species with a diameter at breast height ≥ 10 cm was carried out in two 800-ha blocks, in two rainforest sites located in northern Congo. We used inhomogeneous and intertype K functions to study the spatial pattern of termite mounds and of tree species around mounds, respectively. We found that mounds in Loundoungou were over-dispersed within a radius of less than 70 m, while those in Mokabi were randomly spaced. Tree species within a 20-m radius around a mound were aggregated towards the mound, e.g.               Entandrophragma cylindricum               , randomly distributed, or even repulsed by the mound. The specific responses also differed in the two sites. These results suggest that (i) the mounds in Loundoungou were created by savannah termite species 3,000-2,000 years BP during the Late Holocene Rainforest Crisis and (ii) the mounds in Mokabi are characteristic of forest mounds. The impact of termite mounds on the spatial pattern of tree species is thus site-dependent, and these differences might be due to species seed dispersal strategies and to soil calcium concentrations.},

Diversity indices of such communities and the relative abundance of the 21 most commonly observed species were compared from standardized line-transect data across 25 study sites distributed in undisturbed forests in French Guiana.We first assessed the relevance of a forest typology based on geomorphological landscapes to explain the observed heterogeneity. As previously found for tree beta-diversity patterns, this new typology proved to be a non-negligible factor underlying the beta diversity of the communities of medium- to large bodied vertebrates inFrenchGuianan terra firme forests. Although the species studied are almost ubiquitous across the region, they exhibited habitat preferences through significant variation in abundance and in their association index with the different landscape types. As terra firme forests represent more than90\%of the Amazon basin, characterizing their heterogeneity – including faunal communities – is a major challenge in neotropical forest ecology.}

  abstract = {Tropical forests shelter the highest species diversity worldwide, although genus diversity is lower than expected. In the species‐rich genera, species complexes are composed of closely‐related species that share large amounts of genetic variation. Despite the key role of species complexes in diversification, evolution and functioning of ecological communities, little is known on why species complexes arise and how they are maintained in Neotropical forests. Examining how individual phenotypes vary along environmental gradients, within and among closely‐related species within species complexes, can reveal processes allowing species coexistence within species complexes. We examined leaf functional trait variation with topography in a hyperdiverse tropical forest of the Guiana Shield. We collected leaf functional traits from 766 trees belonging to five species in two species complexes in permanent plots encompassing a diversity of topographic positions. We tested the role of topography on leaf functional trait variation with a hierarchical Bayesian model, controlling for individual tree diameter effect. We show that, mirroring what has been previously observed among species and communities, individual leaf traits covary from acquisitive to conservative strategy within species. Moreover, decreasing wetness from bottomlands to plateaus was associated with a shift of leaf traits from an acquisitive to a conservative strategy both across and within closely‐related species. Our results suggest that intraspecific trait variability widens species' niches and converges at species' margins where niches overlap, potentially implying local neutral processes. Intraspecific trait variability favors local adaptation and divergence of closely‐related species within species complexes. It is potentially maintained through interspecific sharing of genetic variation through hybridization.}

  abstract = {The identity of the dominant root-associated microbial symbionts in a forest determines the ability of trees to access limiting nutrients from atmospheric or soil pools, sequester carbon and withstand the effects of climate change. Characterizing the global distribution of these symbioses and identifying the factors that control this distribution are thus integral to understanding the present and future functioning of forest ecosystems. Here we generate a spatially explicit global map of the symbiotic status of forests, using a database of over 1.1 million forest inventory plots that collectively contain over 28,000 tree species. Our analyses indicate that climate variables—in particular, climatically controlled variation in the rate of decomposition—are the primary drivers of the global distribution of major symbioses. We estimate that ectomycorrhizal trees, which represent only 2\% of all plant species, constitute approximately 60\% of tree stems on Earth. Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis dominates forests in which seasonally cold and dry climates inhibit decomposition, and is the predominant form of symbiosis at high latitudes and elevation. By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees dominate in aseasonal, warm tropical forests, and occur with ectomycorrhizal trees in temperate biomes in which seasonally warm-and-wet climates enhance decomposition. Continental transitions between forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal trees occur relatively abruptly along climate-driven decomposition gradients; these transitions are probably caused by positive feedback effects between plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic nitrogen fixers—which are insensitive to climatic controls on decomposition (compared with mycorrhizal fungi)—are most abundant in arid biomes with alkaline soils and high maximum temperatures. The climatically driven global symbiosis gradient that we document provides a spatially explicit quantitative understanding of microbial symbioses at the global scale, and demonstrates the critical role of microbial mutualisms in shaping the distribution of plant species.}
